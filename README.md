# Meme Generator

Practiced creating a React meme app through ([Scrimba courses](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)), I'm currently planning to update generator to become a cat meme generator using [CAT API](https://thecatapi.com/), and my next feature is to have the user to be able to download the meme they created, wish me luck :tada:

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

To Run app:
```npm start```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
